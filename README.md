# micro_blog
Creating micro-blog using Python/Dango, html/css.

In this project I coded a micro-blog, where created User can create new articles. 

On main page:
1)User is able to choose article with favorite title, author and partial description. If he clicks on the title link, he goes to detail page.
2)Also on the page he can create own article using button "Yes".

On detail page:
1) User can see all information about article.
2) User is able to come back to main page clicking the link and choose another article.

Using html/css I could hide part description of article and define the fill color of the text.
